# LFR Notes for Castle Nathria
A brief set of notes you can copy/paste into your Castle Nathria LFR to help people understand the fights.


## The Leeching Vaults
### Huntsman Altimor:
`/i STAND STILL for Sinskeer and let others dodge the big red arrows. Everyone else: Dodge the big red arrows. :) Share damage for the swirly circles. HEAL THE RIPPED SOULS on second add. CC then kill the Shade bears when they spawn.`

`/i RUN OUT if you get Petrifying Howl. Use Hero on second bear (Bargast).`


### Hungering Destroyer:
`/i Everyone but tanks stack at one spot. RUN TO THE SIDE if you get Volatile Ejection. STACK with everyone if you get a white circle around you.`

`/i Spread for thin blue circles around everyone, then group up again. RUN OUT when the boss gets a huge circle around him, then regroup at the mark. Hero on pull.`


### Lady Inerva Darkvein:
`/i Soak the small red circles on the ground. If you get a big red circle around you, run JUST outside of the melee group. You will drop an add. Whole raid kills it.`

`/i If you get linked by lines, RUN OUT and put the lines over the red balls. Just like connect the dots. YOU MUST DO THIS OR YOU WIPE US. Hero on third anima canister.`


## Reliquary of Opulence
### Sun King's Salvation
`/i DPS: SOUL INFUSERS MUST DIE INSTANTLY - CC or stun them to prevent them from reaching the pedestals. Focus the big gargoyles when up. When Kael jumps down, RANGE focus the phoenixes and kill them fast. Stay behind Kael.`

`/i Healers: Heal Kael up on the platform whenever you can. `

`/i Everyone: Click the pedestals to channel-heal Kael. DO NOT CLICK IF SOMEONE ELSE IS CLICKING, you will interrupt them. Line up and click in turn. Repeat when your debuff drops. Share damage on red circles.`


### Artificer Xy'mox
(Raid lead should place the yellow star world mark at the tank spot, and orange circle world mark at the opposite side of the room. On phase 3, move the mark to the tip of the sucky sword nearest the raid.)

`/i Two people get Dimensional Tear. You will both drop a portal that teleports between the two spots. Use the portal if you are chased by a ghost. DO NOT DROP PORTALS TOGETHER.`

`/i One portal ALWAYS at Yellow Star. Second one is at Orange Circle. CHECK YOUR MARK and go to that mark. Orange mark will move for P3. Go to the new mark spot.`

`/i Dodge the white lines. Run away from ghosts - they MC you. DPS MC'ed people to break them. Pick up blue seeds and move them to the far side of the room - you will die if you stand in the blue explosion.`

`/i When he does the sucky sword, RUN OUT OF IT. Stay near the wall. Use the orange circle portal to escape if you get sucked in. Use hero at start of third phase (sucky sword).`


### Council of Blood
`/i We will kill Niklaus, then Stavros, then Frieda. SINGLE TARGET - the others heal when you kill one, so no use in cleaving. If you get Dark Recital, run WITH YOUR PARTNER away from the group - you will drop blood puddles.`

`/i For the Dance Macabre, RUN TO YOUR SPOTLIGHT. Each person has their own spot. Follow the instructions - move one square to the red puddle next to you. Four moves, then back to the boss.`

`/i Focus adds when they spawn. Never be in front of or behind Lord Stavros - you will die. Interrupt Frieda whenever you can. Spread for blood circles. Dodge the vampire dancers. Hero after Dance on Stavros.`


## Blood from Stone
### Shriekwing
`/i HIDE FAR BEHIND PILLARS FOR EARSPLITTING SHRIEK. If hit, you leave behind blood puddles that kill people. Run to wall for Echo Location. More puddles.`

`/i Move away when he immunes and knocks you back, you can't damage him. Just hide near the walls and dodge him and the little white orbs. If the orbs hit you, yup, more puddles. Hero on pull.`


### Sludgefist
`/i DODGE HIS CHARGE. Tanks will direct him to the pillars. If he misses a pillar and hits a wall, we wipe. Run out of his big stomp and don't stand in the brown crap.`

`/i Never stand in front of boss or near the tanks, you will die. Hero when he hits the third pillar.`


### Stone Legion Generals
`/i Run JUST out of group for Reverberating Leap and Crystallize. Tanks have to stand in the puddles it leaves behind to clear stacks. During intermission, grab red anima balls and run them to Renethal.`

`/i ALWAYS FOCUS ADD FIRST; boss takes reduced damage when add is up. Hero on phase three (when both generals are down). Kill both generals at the same time.`


## An Audience with Arrogance
### Sire Denathrius
`/i Phase 1: FOCUS ADDS. Follow tanks out of the red crap. You have a debuff with four stacks. STAND IN THE BOSS FRONTAL ATTACK to drop stacks - you want 2-3 stacks by end of phase. Run out of group for Feeding Time.`

`/i Transition: WALK TO BOSS. You can't use speed abilities. You will die if you don't reach boss.`

`/i Phase 2: FOCUS ADDS. Follow tanks through the mirror to get out of Sire's big explosion. Dodge the lines from the giant zippy sword. Don't be in front of boss. If you get a big circle around you, run out.`

`/i Phase 3: Hero. Burn the boss. Stay towards mid. Don't stand in blood. Don't be in front of boss. If you get a big circle around you, run out. Dodge the big boss explosion.`
